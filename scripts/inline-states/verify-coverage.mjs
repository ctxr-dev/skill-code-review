// verify-coverage.mjs — deterministic implementation of FSM state Step 8.
//
// Inputs (from env):
//   - findings          : deduped findings from Step 7
//   - picked_leaves     : { id, path, justification, dimensions[] }[]
//   - coverage_rescues  : { file, rescued_leaf, reason }[] from Step 4 (B4)
//   - changed_paths     : string[]
//
// Outputs:
//   - coverage_matrix         : [{ file, reviewers[] }] — per file, list of leaf ids that touched it
//   - coverage_gaps           : string[] — files reviewed by < 2 specialists after rescues
//   - coverage_rule_violated  : boolean — true iff any gap remains after rescues (B4 hard signal)
//
// Coverage rule (B4): every changed file must be reviewed by ≥ 2 specialists.
// `coverage_rescues[]` from Step 4 is consulted before reporting gaps — the
// trim worker explicitly nominates additional leaves to lift undercovered
// files. Any file still below 2 reviewers AFTER rescue application sets
// `coverage_rule_violated: true`, which `synthesize-release-readiness.mjs`
// promotes to NO-GO so the rule is engine-enforced instead of advisory.
//
// We build the matrix from THREE sources:
//   (a) each finding's `flagged_by[]` (specialists that produced findings on the file),
//   (b) picked_leaves credited broadly (one entry per file × leaf): the FSM
//       schema for picked_leaves does not currently carry per-leaf path
//       signals (file_globs / activation_match), so broad credit is the
//       most honest default until B6 (#11) widens the schema. Silence is
//       precision — a leaf that inspected and emitted no findings is still
//       a reviewer for the file.
//   (c) coverage_rescues — each rescue maps a file → leaf that was promoted
//       precisely to lift that file's coverage.
